# MassTexting
Mass texting script in python using Twilio's API.

To use, just open up the GUI and load up a CSV file with just the phone numbers in the first column.

# Uses
Needed a quick script during a hackthon we were running to message all the attendees easily and get announcements out so I whipped this up.

I also hate using going back into the code to keep editing it for what I want to say, so it's got a simple GUI in place to make it more user friendly.

# Setup
Just get a Twilio Account, pay for some messaging credits and a number and then install the Twilio Helper Library using the pip installer as shown below.

```python
pip install twilio
```
# Have Fun!
